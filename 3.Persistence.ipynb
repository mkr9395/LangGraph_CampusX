    "\n",

    "### Key points about **persistence in LangGraph**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **State Storage**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * The graph‚Äôs **state** (variables, memory, messages, intermediate outputs, etc.) is stored in a backend.\n",
    "   * Supported backends include **SQLite, PostgreSQL, Redis, MongoDB, Weaviate, DynamoDB**, or even simple file-based persistence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Checkpoints**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * LangGraph uses **checkpoints** to capture the state at specific points in execution.\n",
    "   * When you restart, the graph can **resume execution from the last checkpoint**, instead of starting over.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Use Cases**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Long-running workflows (e.g., multi-turn conversations, document analysis).\n",
    "   * Fault-tolerant execution (resuming after crashes).\n",
    "   * Multi-agent systems where state continuity matters.\n",
    "   * Human-in-the-loop workflows where you pause and later resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How it looks in practice**\n",
    "   You typically initialize a graph with a **persistence layer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   from langgraph.checkpoint.sqlite import SqliteSaver\n",
    "\n",
    "   # create persistence\n",
    "   checkpoint = SqliteSaver.from_conn_string(\"checkpoints.db\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # pass persistence when compiling graph\n",
    "   app = graph.compile(checkpointer=checkpoint)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   Now the graph will automatically save state into `checkpoints.db` and reload it if you call it again with the same thread ID."

    "### 2. **Fault Tolerance**\n",
    "\n",
